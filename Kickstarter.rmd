>“Walking around to different banks and investors to present a slide deck in person?  That’s so old school.  The internet has opened up so many opportunities that weren’t there before.  It’s up to you to capitalize on them, but that doesn’t mean going in without a plan.”
 
**Bio:**

Adam is a project manager for a software development company.  He and his best friend from college, Michael, have an idea for an app that started because they were tired of going out with friends only to discover that it was a 45 minute wait to get into a restaurant that doesn’t take reservations, or that the bar they wanted to check out is packed full.  Their app would allow you to enter the name of the too-full restaurant and search nearby and suggest venues with similar food, ambiance, price points, etc.  They want to partner with new restaurants as well so that suggestions can cater to those who want to try something new.  However, both of them work very demanding jobs and they don’t have enough free time to work on their dream.
 
**User Goals:**

- Quit his job to focus on the app full-time

- Build the app and turn it into a startup
 
**User Needs:**

- Needs to be able to raise funds fairly quickly and, because he has a demanding job, without too much time and effort required.

- Needs to be able to pay rent in Washington, DC, his student loans, car payments, and other living expenses—like food!  So, if it doesn’t raise at least a certain amount, it may not be worth it if he doesn’t raise enough to quit his job.

- Wants to be able to create a data-driven campaign for the best chances of success.
 
**Pain Points:**

- He doesn’t want to have to talk to people to raise money.  It takes a lot of time and is very draining for him as an introvert.

- He is not a data analyst, so even though there is a lot of data out there, he finds it a bit overwhelming.

- He’s short on time.
 
**Beliefs:**

- Success is made, not given.  Entrepreneurship is the only way to ensure success.

- Everybody has this problem of crowded restaurants--they’ll definitely want my app!

- I will be in that 1%.
 
**Biases/Preferences:**

- Digital first - The first question is always, “Can I do it online?”

- Is okay with taking some risk, but prefers they be calculated
 
**Expertise:**

- As a project manager, he’s pretty comfortable with creating a plan and executing it with a team, managing budgets, and staying on track.  This seems to him that it would be like running a business, but he has not actually run a business before.

- He has occasionally supported Kickstarter campaigns, but has never created any type of crowdfunding or fundraising campaign before.
 
**Personality:**

- Introvert

- Likes to be helpful and share his knowledge

- Deliberate

- Planner
